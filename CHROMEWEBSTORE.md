## Store Listing

**Extension Name**
X Bulk Clean

**Short Description**
Free bulk cleanup tools for X. Delete posts/replies, remove likes/reposts, manage follows, and export CSV backups locally.

**Detailed Description**
X Bulk Clean is a free, open-source Chrome extension that runs entirely inside your browser to help you clean up and manage your X (formerly Twitter) account. It requires no license keys, subscriptions, external backends, or payment.

Key features:
- Delete posts and replies in bulk with visual confirmation
- Preview posts, replies, or reposts in Chrome's side panel and choose exactly what to delete
- Filter scanned results by text, keywords, and dates, and use advanced selection controls (Select All, Invert, Select None)
- Undo reposts and remove likes
- Follow followers or verified followers in bulk
- Bulk unfollow accounts you follow
- Prevent overlapping cleanup jobs and monitor active jobs from an on-page status panel
- Persistent, account-aware job history showing dates, times, counts, and affected records
- Export activity backups as CSV before performing destructive actions
- Optional performance mode to hide tweet-media during scans to save resources

How to use:
1. Open X (Twitter) in your active Chrome tab and ensure you are logged in.
2. Click the extension icon to open the popup or the "Preview & Select" side panel.
3. Choose an action (e.g., Delete posts/replies, Remove likes, Follow/Unfollow).
4. For Delete/Repost scans, review the list of scanned items, filter them if needed, select/deselect items, and confirm.
5. Watch the automated cleanup run directly on the page, or stop/pause it at any time.

Important safety note:
Bulk cleanups are destructive and cannot be reversed by the extension. We highly recommend exporting a CSV backup of your scanned records first and starting with a small batch of items.
